# Native Installation

## Requirements

Before building Teedy from source, you will need to install several prerequisites, including Java 11+, Maven 3+, NPM, Grunt, Tesseract 4, ffmpeg, and mediainfo.
We give instructions for installing these prerequisites on several platforms below.

### Linux (Ubuntu 22.04)

```console
sudo apt install \
  default-jdk \
  ffmpeg \
  grunt \
  maven \
  npm \
  tesseract-ocr \
  tesseract-ocr-ara \
  tesseract-ocr-ces \
  tesseract-ocr-chi-sim \
  tesseract-ocr-chi-tra \
  tesseract-ocr-dan \
  tesseract-ocr-deu \
  tesseract-ocr-fin \
  tesseract-ocr-fra \
  tesseract-ocr-heb \
  tesseract-ocr-hin \
  tesseract-ocr-hun \
  tesseract-ocr-ita \
  tesseract-ocr-jpn \
  tesseract-ocr-kor \
  tesseract-ocr-lav \
  tesseract-ocr-nld \
  tesseract-ocr-nor \
  tesseract-ocr-pol \
  tesseract-ocr-por \
  tesseract-ocr-rus \
  tesseract-ocr-spa \
  tesseract-ocr-swe \
  tesseract-ocr-tha \
  tesseract-ocr-tur \
  tesseract-ocr-ukr \

```

### Mac

```console
brew install \
  ffmpeg \
  grunt-cli \
  maven \
  mediainfo \
  npm \
  openjdk \
  tesseract \
  tesseract-lang
```

### Windows

It is highly recommended that you proceed to install Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL), following the link: [Install Linux on Windows with WSL
](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). This will allow you to run a Linux distro (Ubuntu's the default) within the Windows environment, and you can then proceed to follow the Linux (Ubuntu 22.04) instructions to install the dependencies.

**Note**: This would mean that you should proceed to execute the following instructions within the Linux environment as well.


## How to build Teedy from the sources

Prerequisites: JDK 11, Maven 3, NPM, Grunt, Tesseract 4

Teedy is organized in several Maven modules:

- docs-core
- docs-web
- docs-web-common

First off, clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sustech-cs304/Teedy`
or download the sources from GitHub.

### Launch the build

From the root directory:

```console
mvn clean -DskipTests install
```

### Run a stand-alone version

From the `docs-web` directory:

```console
mvn jetty:run
```

### Build a .war to deploy to your servlet container

From the `docs-web` directory:

```console
mvn -Pprod -DskipTests clean install
```

You will get your deployable WAR in the `docs-web/target` directory.
